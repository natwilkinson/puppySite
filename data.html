<p>I am interested in anlayzing data about chemistry majors at Georgia Tech for the last ten years. I want to look at the number of students that switch to a different major (other than chemistry/biochemistry) and I want to analyze the later careers of chemistry majors. Some career categories would include graduate school, medical school, lab technicians at a university, industrial lab technition appointments, and government positions. In addition to their later careers, I want to look at their annual salery two years after graduation and five years after graduation. This will help me better understand whether it's more beneficial for me to go to graduate school or go into industry right after graduation. </p>
